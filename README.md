# WebPageSummer
Firefox/Chrome extension to summarize a web page using AI with one click. 
Created by me, a non programmer, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet and CodeCompanion.ai. So any mistakes blame them, not me. :)

The WebPageSummarizerCH zip file is for Chrome, the FF file is for Firefox. I know the Chrome one works, not sure about Firefox (it used to work).
